## JMM15-opensource

This is the collection of source files for a "poster+5" presentation
at the 2015 Joint Mathematics Meetings. The relevant session is run by a
professional development committee, and is dedicated to using open source
materials in college math classrooms.

The main branch of this repo has the latex files (.tex and .sty) for a beamer
poster.

The gh-pages branch will hold the slides for the 5 minute lightning talk. This
will be done with reveal.js.
